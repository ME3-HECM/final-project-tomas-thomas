## Project Challenge and Instructions
<a name="project-challenge-and-instructions"></a>

### Challenge brief

Your task is to develop an autonomous robot that can navigate a "mine" using a series of instructions coded in coloured cards and return to its starting position.  Your robot must be able to perform the following: 

1. Navigate towards a coloured card and stop before impacting the card
1. Read the card colour
1. Interpret the card colour using a predefined code and perform the navigation instruction
1. When the final card is reached, navigate back to the starting position
1. Handle exceptions and return back to the starting position if final card cannot be found

### "Mine" environment specification

A "mine" is contstructed from black plywood walls 100mm high with some walls having coloured cards located on the sides of the maze to assist with navigation. The following colour code is to be used for navigation:

No | Colour | Instruction
---------|---------|--------
1 | Red | Turn Right 90
2 | Green | Turn Left 90
3 | Blue | Turn 180
4 | Yellow | Reverse 1 square and turn right 90
5 | Pink | Reverse 1 square and turn left 90
6 | Orange | Turn Right 135
7 | Light blue | Turn Left 135 
8 | White | Finish (return home) 
(0) | Black | Maze wall colour

Mine courses will vary in difficulty, with the simplest requiring 4 basic moves to navigate. More advanced courses may require 10 or more moves to navigate. The mines may have features such as dead ends but colour cards will always direct you to the end of the maze. Once the end of the maze has been reached, you must return to the starting position. Colours used in the course or how many is unknown in advance.
Final testing will take place in the CAGB 6th Floor Drawing Room and testing areas will be provided around the mechatronics lab. The exact layout of the maze(s) will not be known in advance. You will also be asked to give a short presentation on the testing day.

## Introduction
<a name="introduction"></a>
This project involved coding a buggy in using a clicker2 board comprising of a PIC18 Advanced microcontroller. The aim of the project was to produce an autonomous buggy, which can navigate its way through an unknown maze using the coloured walls as directions for its operations. It would store these operations, remembering its path through the maze and then return back to the beginning after having completed the maze. In the case of getting lost or hitting a dead end, the buggy would automatically trigger its operation to return back to the beginning of the maze.

This project consisted of 5 key functionalities: Movement, Movement Calibration, Light Sensing, Light Calibration, and Path Memorisation. These are explained in detail in the following sections, along with examples of the code employed and its structure. To complete this task, these key functionalities were split between us and completed in branches on Github and then merged together into our main file. This allowed individual work to be carried out initially, before working together side-by-side on the final functionalities and integration of our work. 

Some hardware modifications were made to the buggy to improve performance. After testing, we found that our specific buggy operated more consistently (moving in straighter lines, turning with less slip) with the rubber wheels removed. We also added a small, black cardboard shield over the Color Click module; this was done to limit ambient light from entering the color click sensing channels and affecting readings. This allowed for more accurate and consistent readings from the color sensor. No further modifications were made.

The links in this section contain videos showing a run through of a simple maze, made using the test set-up in the Mechatronics Lab on the 7th Floor, and a run through in the case of an exemption - final destination not found (buggy lost).
